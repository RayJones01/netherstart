# 🔥 Netherstart
**A hardcore Nether survival plugin for Minecraft Paper 1.21+**

Every player begins their journey trapped in the Nether.  
Death means banishment. When all souls are gone, the world ends — literally.  
But through bartering with Piglins, a single spark of hope can emerge: the **Soul Totem**.

---

## 🌑 Core Features
- **Spawn in the Nether:** All players start in the fiery depths.
- **Permanent Death:** Dying instantly bans a player.
- **Server Shutdown:** When all joined players are banned, the server stops.
- **Soul Totems:** Rarely obtained through Piglin bartering — used to revive others.
- **Revival Command:** `/revive <player>` consumes a Soul Totem to unban a fallen player.

---

## ⚔️ Long-Term Goal
The ultimate challenge:  
**Defeat the four Nether Trials** — Elder Guardian, Wither, Ender Dragon, and Warden.  
Only then can your souls escape the Nether’s curse.
